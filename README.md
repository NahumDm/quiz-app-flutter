## Quiz Flutter ðŸŽ‰

## Description
Quiz Flutter is a simple mobile application built with Flutter. Designed as a fun and educational tool, the app presents users with a question, offers "True" or "False" buttons to submit answers, and displays an alert saying "The quiz ended" once all questions are completed. This project is a hands-on exploration of Flutter development, created to solidify foundational programming skills and experiment with Dart.

## Purpose ðŸ“š
This project is solely for learning purposes. It serves as a playground for me, Nahom Desta, to practice Flutter and Dart concepts while building a functional app. Itâ€™s not intended for production use but rather as a stepping stone in my development journey.

## Features âœ¨
Random Questions: Enjoy a fresh set of true-or-false questions each time you play.
True/False Buttons: Answer questions with intuitive "True" or "False" buttons.
Quiz Completion Alert: Receive a pop-up message saying "The quiz ended" when you finish.

## Lessons Learned ðŸ§ 
While building this project, I explored and deepened my understanding of:

- Classes and Objects: Structuring data and behavior in Dart.
- OOP Core Concepts:
    - Inheritance: Reusing code through class hierarchies.
    - Polymorphism: Flexibility in handling different data types.
    - Encapsulation: Hiding implementation details for cleaner code.
    - Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems with clear interfaces.
- Flutter Widgets: Mastering the Expanded widget and other UI tools for layout design.

## License ðŸ“œ
